I'm a proud mother of 3 wonderful girls and the wife to the love of my life. I have had a love of photography ever since I can remember, it runs in the family. I'm a Winnipeg based photographer specializing in family, children and newborn photography. I love to capture life's precious moments and I would be honoured to capture some of you and your family's special moments too! I look forward to working with you!
